# My Personal Wikipedia

I created this website to keep my notes about certain topics, books etc.
It's a demo with a single entry to hopefully show how I use it.

Since learning is a constant process I don't try to make my notes perfect,
I rely on the fact I will be updating them as I use them.
I also think notes are personal shortcuts to concepts that shouldn't be shared
because of the confusion and errors they might cause.

## Reusability

The use of variables makes the website very easy to edit
both visually and functionally.
The documentation makes it simple to understand my design preferences.
